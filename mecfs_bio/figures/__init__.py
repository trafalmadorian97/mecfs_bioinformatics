"""
Functionality to generate plots and tables from build system assets, and upload them to Github.

This approach allows plots and tables in documentation to be generated programmatically, instead of manually.

Benefits of automatic figure generation:
- The full lineage of all plots and tables can be fully interrogated.
- Improvements in the code used to generate a class of figures can easily be propagated to all figures of that class.
