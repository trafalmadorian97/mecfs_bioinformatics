"""
Functionality to generate plots and tables from build system assets, and upload them to Github,

The idea is to then reference these plots and tables in documentation.  In this way, plots and tables in documentation are generated programmatically, not manually
This allows the full lineage of all plots and tables to be fully interrogated.
