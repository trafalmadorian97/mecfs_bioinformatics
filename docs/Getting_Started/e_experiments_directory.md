## Motivation

In research projects, it is often necessary to write a lot of experimental code. Subjecting this experimental code to
normal code review would be counterproductive, because doing so would slow down the pace of exploration,and
because
much of this code will be ultimately unused.

Nevertheless, it is still valuable to commit this experimental code to Github, to create a historical record of past experiments.

This motivates the `experiments` directory: a place to store rough, un-tested, experimental scripts.
