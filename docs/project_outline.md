This project aims to bring to bear bioinformatic techniques to advance the understanding of ME/CFS and other poorly-understood diseases.

# Principles

## Reproducibility

It should be possible to reproduce any of main analyses with a few lines of Python code. In support of this principle, the downloading of auxiliary data and the installation of software tools should be automated.


## Verification

We should verify the correctness of our code and our analysis. 

Techniques for achieving this include:

- We should implement unit and integration tests.
- Whenever we apply biostatistical software to ME/CFS data, we should apply the same software to data from a better-understood disease and verify that the results are consistent with the known biology of that disease.
