# MAGMA HBA

I applied MAGMA to the PGC 2022 GWAS of schizophrenia using single-cell RNAseq read-counts from the [Human Brain Atlas](../../Data_Sources/Human_Brain_Atlas/HBA_scRNAseq.md)[@siletti2023transcriptomic] as reference data. This was an attempt to verify that I could reproduce the results of Duncan et al.[@duncan2025mapping].


## Results

The results are plotted below:

These results closely match those of Duncan et al.  Like Duncan et al., we find that the most significant cell type for Schizophrenia is the Somatostatin MGE Interneuron.
