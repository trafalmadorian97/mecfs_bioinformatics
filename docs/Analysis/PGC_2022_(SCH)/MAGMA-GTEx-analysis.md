# MAGMA GTEx analysis

I applied MAGMA to the PGC 2022 GWAS of Schizophrenia[@trubetskoy2022mapping] using the [GTEx bulk RNAseq dataset ](../../Data_Sources/GTEx_RNAseq_Data.md) as a reference.  The results are plotted below:



![GTEX_RNA_MAGMA_SCH](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/58260863-c5d6-4cd7-8b24-fc9442e21ef8).


Similar to the results when S-LDSC is applied to this GWAS using the GTEx/Franke lab reference, GTEx MAGMA analysis identifies the brain as a key site of disease activity, but is unable to pinpoint a specific region.
