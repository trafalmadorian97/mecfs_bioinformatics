# Chr6 26M to 27M

## Methodology

In an attempt to narrow down the DecodeME[@genetics2025initial] GWAS-1 signal, I [fine-mapped](../../../../Bioinformatics_Concepts/Fine_Mapping.md) the first GWAS-1 hit on chromosome 6 using SUSIE[@wang2020simple]. The parameters of my SUSIE runs were the same as for the [chromosome 1 hit](Chr1_173M_174M_Locus.md)

None of the SUSIE runs at this locus found credible sets.  Given that this locus lies in the HLA region, which is notorious for its complex LD structure, this result is perhaps unsurprising.
