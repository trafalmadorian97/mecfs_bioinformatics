# Overview

Johnston et al. performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of Multisite Chronic Pain (MCP) using data from 387,649 UK Biobank participants. To quantify MCP, participants reported the number of body sites where they had experienced pain recently and for at least 3 months, with values ranging from 0 to 7. The study identified 76 independent SNPs at 39 loci which were significantly associated with MCP.[@johnston2019genome]

Notably, the [DecodeME study](../../Data_Sources/DecodeME.md) found that ME/CFS colocalized with MCP near the gene that encodes carbonic anhydrase-related protein 10 (CA10). This locus on chromosome 17 was also found to colocalize with a variant which is associated with increased expression of CA10 in the prostate.[@genetics2025initial] CA10 is most highly expressed in tissues of the central nervous system.[@uhlen2015tissue][@proteinAtlasCA10TissueExpression] Research suggests that CA10 localizes to neural synapses and binds to neurexins, which are proteins involved in synaptogenesis.[@sterky2017carbonic] These links between CA10 and the nervous system align with other findings which suggest nervous system involvement in both chronic pain and ME/CFS, such as significant MAGMA brain tissue enrichment in both of the above studies.[@johnston2019genome][@genetics2025initial]

Several studies have also noted a high rate of pain in individuals with ME/CFS.[@board2015beyond] Consistent with previous research, the DecodeME study found that 86.1% of 16,730 ME/CFS cases reported experiencing muscle pain.[@genetics2025initial] 

To potentially gain further insights into both chronic pain and ME/CFS, the `mecfs_bioinformatics` repo was used to further analyze Johnston et al.'s MCP study.
