# MAGMA GTEx

I applied MAGMA analysis to the Verweiji et al.'s GWAS of heart rate recovery after exercise[@verweij2018genetic], using [GTEx bulk RNAseq data](../../Data_Sources/GTEx_RNAseq_Data.md)[@gtex2020gtex] as a reference.


# Results

The results are shown in the bar plot below:

There are two significant tissue types: the atrial appendage and the gastroesophageal junction. The atrial appendage may be stand-in for cardiac tissue in general, and could reflect the role of general heart health in recovery from exercise.  Alternatively, this could reflect the importance of pacemaker cells near the atrial appendage in controlling heart rate. The significance of the gastroesophageal junction is unclear.
