# MAGMA GTEx


I applied MAGMA to the Alzhiemer's GWAS of Bellenguez et al. using a reference dataset derived from bulk [GTEx RNAseq](../../Data_Sources/GTEx_Project/GTEx_RNAseq_Data.md).  The gene-property analysis results are plotted in the bar plot below.

Three of the four significant tissues types (Whole blood, Spleen, Ileum Lymphode aggregate) are immune-related, which is consistent with theories of Alzheimer's as an immune-related disease.  How to interpret the significant hit at "Liver portal tract" is less obvious.
