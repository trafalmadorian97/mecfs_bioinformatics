# MAGMA GTEx


I applied [MAGMA](../../Bioinformatics_Concepts/MAGMA_Overview.md) to the Alzhiemer's GWAS of Bellenguez et al.[@bellenguez2022new] using a reference dataset derived from [GTEx bulk RNAseq data](../../Data_Sources/GTEx_RNAseq_Data.md)[@gtex2020gtex].  The gene-property analysis results are plotted below.

Three of the four significant tissues types (Whole blood, Spleen, Ileum Lymphode aggregate) are immune-related, which is consistent with theories of Alzheimer's as an immune-related disease.  How to interpret the significant hit at "Liver portal tract" is less obvious.
