I applied MAGMA to Keaton et al.'s[@keaton2024genome] meta-GWAS of diastolic blood pressure, using the [GTEx bulk RNAseq](../../Data_Sources/GTEx_RNAseq_Data.md) as a reference.  The significant and top non-significant tissue types are plotted below.

Besides the expected arterial, heart-related tissues, and kidney-related tissues, a large number of reproductive tissues are found to be significant.  As discussed [here](S-LDSC-DBP_Analysis.md), this may be due to common smooth-muscle transcriptional programs, or due to the influence of sex hormones on blood pressure.
