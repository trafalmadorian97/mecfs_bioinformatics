The Immgen project[@aguilar2020immgen] aims to build a public resource describing gene expression and gene regulation in the mouse immune system.  For each cell type in a highly granular taxonomy of mouse immune cell types, the Immgen project seeks to record:

- mRNA expression levels
- [Epigenetic](../Bioinformatics_Concepts/Epigenetics.md) information describing chromatin regulation.
- Information of the relationship between mRNA and protein levels.

## Uses 

Because of its extreme granularity, and because of the broad similarity between the mouse and human immune systems, Immgen reference data can be combined with GWAS summary statistics to suggest the key immune-system cells involved in a phenotype.
