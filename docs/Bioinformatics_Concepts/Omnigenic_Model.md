In a [small-world network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small-world_network), the number of steps $L$ between two random nodes  grows at a rate proportional to the $\log$ of the number of nodes $N$.  Consequently, typical nodes in very large networks are separated by a small number of steps.  The game [Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_degrees_of_separation#Kevin_Bacon_Game) is a classic illustration.


The Omnigenic Model proposes that gene regulatory pathways are a small-world network.  Therefore, for a typical trait, even though only a small number of **core genes** directly control the trait, a large number of **peripheral genes** are within only a few regulatory steps of the core genes.
