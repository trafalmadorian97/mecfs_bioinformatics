## Introduction

Neglecting somatic mutations, all non-gamete cells in a person's body contain the same DNA.  Despite this, the cells in a multicellular organism are incredibly diverse in their structure and function: adipocytes differ from neurons, which differ from macrophages, which differ from B cells, which differ from cardiomyocytes.

What explains this diversity? Chiefly, the answer is gene expression.  While all genes are present in in the DNA of all cells, different genes are switched on or off in different cell types.


How is gene expression controlled?  There are numerous redundant regulatory systems, but one key system involves histone marks.

## Example: Histone marks

Eukaryotic DNA is tightly wound around spool-like complexes of proteins called histones.  The resulting DNA-histone units are collectively called nucleosomes.

Histones can be covalently bonded to a very wide variety of molecules.  These covalent bonds are called "histone marks".  Histone marks can strongly affect the three-dimensional structure of chromatin.  For example, certain histone marks cause DNA to be tightly wound, so that the genes its contains cannot be transcribed, while other histone marks cause DNA to open up, causing genes to be readily transcribed(Alberts et al. pg 220[@alberts2022molecular]).

Here are some examples of histone marks with known effects:


| Histone Mark | Effect on Chromatin                                    |
|:-------------|:-------------------------------------------------------|

| H4K4me3      | Open, accesible chromatin[@alberts2022molecular]                              |
| H3K9ac       | Open, accesible chromatin[@alberts2022molecular]                              |
| H3K9me3      | Closed, inaccesible chromatin[@alberts2022molecular]                          |
| [H3K27ac]      | [Associated with higher activation of transcription]((https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H3K27ac) |
| H3K27me3     | Closed, inaccesible chromatin[@alberts2022molecular]                          |  


Thus, histone marks constitute part of the answer to the question of how gene expression is controlled.




## Epigenetics

Epigenetics is the study structural and chemical modifications of DNA, that do not change the core base-sequence, but can affect gene expression.  It includes histone marks as well also other kinds of modifications like DNA methylation.
