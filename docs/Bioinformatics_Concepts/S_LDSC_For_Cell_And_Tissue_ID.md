# Stratified Linkage Disequilibrium Score Regression 

Stratified Linkage Disequilibrium Score Regression (S-LDSC)[@finucane2018heritability;@finucane2015partitioning] is an extension of [LDSC](LDSC.md).  S-LDSC relaxes some of the assumptions of LDSC, making it more broadly applicable.  Unlike LDSC, S-LDSC can also be used to generate hypothesis about the key cell-types and tissues underlying a phenotype.
